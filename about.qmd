---

I am a Research Associate in Health Economics at the Manchester Centre for Health Economics, University of Manchester. I also hold an honorary researcher position at the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust.

My research interests include econometrics and health economics. I have experience in conducting health economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness and utility analysis, using regression-based methods and decision-analytic models on key healthcare interventions.

I hold an MSc in Economics (Distinction) and a BA in Economics (First Class), both from the University of Manchester.
